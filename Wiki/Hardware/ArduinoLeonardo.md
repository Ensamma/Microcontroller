If it doesn't come with the cable, you will need a Micro-USB male to USB-A cable.

**Switch Lite users will also need:**

1. A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH))

> The Switch Lite does not have a USB-A port. Therefore you need either an adapter or a hub to connect the ProMicro. A charging hub or dock is required to simultaneously charge and use the ProMicro.
> 
> Portable docks will work for the Switch Lite, but will not be able to output video over the HDMI.
