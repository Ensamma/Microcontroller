# Hardware - Pro Micro

This section covers the required hardware for users who have chosen the Pro Micro.


## Required Hardware

1. [Pro Micro Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BJNV1J3)
2. Micro-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081HDS3WB), [example 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TAM0MZW))

> ***Adapters*** for Micro-USB male to USB-A male are notoriously difficult to find in quantity.
> Cables are easy to find, but less convenient if you just want to plug them into the standing Switch dock.

The basic Pro Micro hardware setup will look like this:

**Switch Lite users will also need:**

1. A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH))

> The Switch Lite does not have a USB-A port. Therefore you need either an adapter or a hub to connect the ProMicro. A charging hub or dock is required to simultaneously charge and use the ProMicro.
> 
> Portable docks will work for the Switch Lite, but will not be able to output video over the HDMI.

## Optional Hardware

* If you are a heavy user, then it is strongly recommended to get a USB-A male-to-female cable with a power switch on it. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T9BRNHW))

* If you intend to change programs very often and will be running the Switch next to a computer, then you will want a USB switch. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Z0Q2SI)) These are like USB-only KVM switches. In fact a regular KVM switch will also work. With this, you no longer have to constantly plug/unplug USBs which will eventually wear them down.
