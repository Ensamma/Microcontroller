# Microcontroller Programs - Hardware Guide

This is the guide for buying and setting up the hardware for the microcontroller programs.

If you already have the hardware, skip ahead to the software tutorial.

## Pick Your Hardware

### Other Controllers:

While not officially supported, the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 and the Arduino Leonardo have been tested to work using either the Teensy 2.0 or Pro Micro .hex files since they all use the same ATmega32u4 processor. The only thing that won't work are the LEDs since the I/O ports are different.

Do not use the other Teensy models (LC, 3.x, 4.x, etc...). They are ARM-based boards which we do not support at this time.


## Next Steps

Continue to the guide for the device you have chosen:

- [Teensy 2.0 or Teensy++ 2.0](Teensy2.md)
- [Pro Micro](ProMicro.md)
- [Arduino Uno R3 (deprecated)](ArduinoUnoR3.md)
