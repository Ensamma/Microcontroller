# Maximizing Switch Stability

Some programs that are timing sensitive will recommend or require that Switch be put into a stabilized state where it is less likely to jitter and drop button presses.

This is most important to the day skippers, but it is also applicable to fault-intolerant programs like [MassRelease](Wiki/Programs/PokemonSwSh/MassRelease.md) and [EggSuperCombined2](Wiki/Programs/PokemonSwSh/EggSuperCombined2.md).

To maximize program stability:

1. Disconnect all controllers and Joy-Cons which are known to drift. (Don’t forget the attached Joy-Cons!)
2. Disconnect from the internet. Unplug the Ethernet cable if you’re wired up.
3. Turn on airplane mode. To run docked, un-dock the Switch, turn on airplane mode, then re-dock. The Switch will remain in airplane mode after re-docking.
4. Restart the Switch if it’s been playing for a while.

Empirical evidence seems to suggest that completely isolating the Switch from outside interference (by shutting off all network traffic) improves stability and reduces the frequency of errors.
