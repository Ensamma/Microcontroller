### What is a "Wall"

A Pokémon **wall** is a mon that takes minimum (or no) damage from the target Pokémon that is being hunted. It enables you to safely use a program such as [ball thrower](BallThrower.md), without the risk of your mon fainting.

> **Note:** It is highly advised that you start out the encounter with a Leppa Berry/Skill swap to ensure the target Pokémon doesn't run out of PP. Especially so if you plan on catching the target Pokémon in a low catch rate ball (ex: Beast Ball)

# Recommended Walls

With the exception of Zapdos and Calyrex (Ghost), every single legendary in Sword/Shield has a wall that is completely immune to it.
